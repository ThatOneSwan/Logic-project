# Logic-project
My final project for computing with logic, an implementation of "A Linear Algebraic Approach to Datalog Evaluation in python using PyDatalog and numpy.
Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
<br />
Pydatalog can be installed using the following pip command at the command line: pip install PyDatalog
<br />
You may also need to in stall Sqlalchemy: pip install Sqlalchemy
<br />
To install numpy, use the following pip command: pip install numpy
If you are running it in an IDE, some of the PyDatalog lines maybe be underlined red, but  they will still work.  The program outputs the matrices R1 and R3 for relations r1(,) and r3(,) as well as the computed matrix R2, and the sets satisfying r2(,).
